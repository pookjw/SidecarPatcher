This script disables this blacklist in macOS. This does NOT patch the iPadOS root system, jailbreaking is not required.

This is a command line script. If you want GUI application, try [free-sidecar](https://github.com/ben-z/free-sidecar) by ben-z.

Tested on macOS 10.15~10.15.4. Doesn't work with macOS 11.0.

## How to patch

It is very unstable. There are many known issues. Read [Issues](https://github.com/pookjw/SidecarPatcher/issues). Please use this at your own risk.

1. Backup `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SidecarCore.framework` folder. This script doesn't provide original system file.

2. Install the latest version of **Command Line Tools** from [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/).

- Requires Apple Developer Account, you can use a free-tier developer account.

3. Disable **System Integrity Protection**. [How to turn off System Integrity Protection on your Mac](https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos). After disabling **System Integrity Protection**, reboot into normal macOS.

- To check SIP is disabled: `csrutil status`

4. Open **Terminal** application and clone this repository by running this command: `git clone https://github.com/pookjw/SidecarPatcher`

5. Run main.swift: `sudo swift SidecarPatcher/main.swift`

- You will need to enter your macOS password.

- Ignore **warnings**. If you encounter error and you don't know how to fix, upload a log to [Issue](https://github.com/pookjw/SidecarPatcher/issues). (I can't reply all issues because I don't know all.)

## How to revert

### Simplest Method (1)

Reinstall your macOS using **macOS Combo Update**. You can download **macOS Combo Update** from [here](https://support.apple.com/downloads/macos). For example, if you're using macOS Catalina 10.15.4, download [macOS Catalina 10.15.4 Combo Update](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2037?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US). It won't erase your data and it will just reinstall the system.

### Simplest Method (2)

Reinstall your macOS using **Install macOS Catalina.app**. Install it without erasing your disk it won't erase your data and it will just reinstall the system.

### Using your backup

1. Disable **System Integrity Protection**. [How to turn off System Integrity Protection on your Mac](https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos).

2. Run `sudo mount -uw /` command.

3. Copy the original SidecarCore folder: `sudo cp /path/to/original /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SidecarCore.framework`

- Make sure you put the right path for SidecarCore `/path/to/original`.

4. Set permission as 755: `sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SidecarCore.framework`
